# BuildJustly Tech4AllBiz
Front end app for Tech4AllBiz project in development by [BuildJustly](https://buildjustly.org/) and Sustainable Progress and [Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective](https://specollective.org/).

## Getting Started

Ensure you have NodeJS version v18.0.0 installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node version. Run `nvm use` to trigger the .nvmrc file.

To start the development environment install the dependencies and run the development server command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

```
npm run lint
```
